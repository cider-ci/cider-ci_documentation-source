# Storage-Resources
{:.no_toc}

All of the resources in this section are prefixed with `/cider-ci/storage`. This
prefix is omitted for brevity in the following. 


## General Properties 

### Uploading 

Uploading is preformed via http `PUT`. 

Every storage artifact has an associated content-type. This content-type is set
from the content-type header of the `PUT` request and therefore should be set
properly. If not specified, the content-type `application/octet-stream` will be
used.


### Retention Time

Uploaded artifacts will be automatically deleted after a retention time
has been reached.

## Trial-Attachments

Trial-Attachments will be listed in the user-interface with the matching
trial. The default retention time is 10 days.

The `:trial_id` should be an existing id of a trial. This is however not
enforced. 

The `*` postfix can be an arbitrary url-path in accordance with the http
path specification, e.g. `screenshots/image01.png`. Query parameters will
be ignored. 

### GET `/tree-attachments/:trial_id/*` 

### PUT `/tree-attachments/:trial_id/*` 

### DELETE `/tree-attachments/:trial_id/*` 


## Tree-Attachments

Tree-Attachments will be listed in the user-interface with the matching
job. The default retention time is 90 days.

Similar restrictions as with the Trial-Attachments apply. 

### GET `/tree-attachments/:tree_id/*` 

### PUT `/tree-attachments/:tree_id/*` 

### DELETE `/tree-attachments/:tree_id/*`
