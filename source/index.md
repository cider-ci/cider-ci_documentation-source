# About Cider-CI

Cider-CI is a service and application stack for continuous integration. It can
be used in the traditional sense as a test runner. But Cider-CI can do much more:

* It takes care of the whole continuous integration procedures from
  **testing**, over **building** to **deployment**.
* It has abstractions for **managing** and altogether **avoiding false test negatives**.
* It supports **running tests in parallel**.
* **Installation and maintenance** is fully **automatized**.
* It is **open source**, no vendor lock in.

There is no substitute for experience. Proceed to the [Quick Start Guide][] and get your Cider-CI environment running with almost no effort.
