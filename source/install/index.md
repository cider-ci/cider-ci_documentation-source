# Installing Cider-CI 
{:.no_toc}
Cider-CI is open source and can be installed with little effort. This page
guides through the process of installing a Cider-CI environment.

## Environment Prerequisites 

<div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6">

Ansible must be present on the *control* machine. See the [Install][] page of
the Ansible Documentation. We use a fairly recent version (â‰¥ 1.8 at the time of
writing) of Ansible. The operating system on the controller is not relevant. We
use MacOS and various Linux variants. 

We use **two Ubuntu 14.04**  machines in this example. One acts as a sever and
the other as the executor. The server machine should have at least 1GB of
memory. 

The working account on the **control machine**  must have **ssh access to the
server and executors**. A setup with SSH keys and without passwords is the
most straight forward configuration. 

The server and executors must reach each other via the **https** protocol (port
443) to function properly. The **example setup** assumes that all machines have
**fixed ipv4 addresses**. **Custom configuration** of protocol and port, as
well as names instead of addresses is **possible** but outside the scope of
this documentation.

## Step by Step Install Procedure for a Demo Environment

1.  We check out the [Cider-CI main project][] including all sub-projects inside 
    the control machine: 

    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci.git` 

2. We descend into the ansible-setup directory.

    `cd cider-ci/ansible-setup` 

3. We adjust the host ip within the `hosts_example` file: 

        [example]
        example-server ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.10 ansible_ssh_user=root
        example-executor1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.11 ansible_ssh_user=root


    It is possible to use just one machine for the server and and executor role.
    This machine must then be added to the `cider-ci-server` and the `cider-ci-executors` 
    group in the hosts file.


4. We invoke ansible-playbook to trigger the install: 

    `ansible-playbook -i hosts_example play_site.yml -e 'system_admin_password=password system_admin_login=adam'`


## Adding Traits 

The example installation will provide the traits `linux` and `bash` for each
executor. They suffice to run the builds of the [Bash Demo Project for
Cider-CI][]. 

### Adding Traits provided by the Ansible Setup 

A set of additional traits can be automatically installed with

`ansible-playbook -i hosts_example play_traits.yml`

### Adding Custom Traits

A custom trait can be added by adding a corresponding line to the file
`/etc/cider-ci/traits.txt`. 


## Production Environment 

The server for a production environment should have at least 4GB of memory.
A fast disk is also recommended. Requirements for the executors depend on the
use case. 

The procedure for installing a production environment is exactly the same as
for the demo environment. However, the parameters for the example environment
are far from optimal. The [Cider-CI Ansible Setup] contains the hosts
file `hosts_zhkd` which is more appropriate to be used as a template in this
case. The directories `host_vars` and `group_vars` contain further files to be
used as templates and to be customized.
