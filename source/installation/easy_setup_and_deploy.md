# Setup and Deploy
{:.no_toc}
This page guides through the process of installing a simple Cider-CI
environment.

This guide is optimized for easiness and providing quick results. After
providing the prerequisites it will just take **3 easy steps** and about
**three minutes** your time to kick off the installation process.

## Introduction

Installing and maintaining a Cider-CI environment is largely an automated
process thanks to the [Cider-CI Deploy Project][]. It supports any mixture of
the _Linux_ based Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty" or Debian 8 "Jessie" operating systems
for the Cider-CI Server and executors. Since Cider-CI version 3.7 "Redmond"
executors running on _Windows_ are supported, too. It is also possible to
install a Cider-CI executor manually on other operating systems.

The remainder of this page focuses on a **simple** setup existing of one
**single machine**. Advanced installation and installing to Windows is out of
the scope of this page but covered in other documents of this documentation.


## Prerequisites and Preparation

<div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6">

The [Cider-CI Deploy Project] relies heavily on Ansible which must must be
present on the *control* machine. See the [Install][] page of the Ansible
Documentation. We use a fairly recent version (â‰¥ 1.9 at the time of writing) of
Ansible. The operating system on the controller is not relevant. We use _Mac OS
X_ and various _Linux_ variants.

The working account on the **control machine** must have **ssh access to all
target machines**. A setup with SSH keys and without passwords to the root
account is the most straight forward configuration.

Accessing machines directly via the root account is now discouraged in many and
effectively disabled in some Linux distributions. Read [How to enable ssh root
access on Ubuntu 14.04][] for example.

## Step by Step Instructions

The following example assumes that a single Linux machine
is ready installed, we call it the `demo-machine`.


1.  We check out the [Cider-CI Main Project][] including all sub-projects inside
    the control machine:

    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci.git`

2. We descend into the deploy directory which is part of the [Cider-CI Deploy Project][]:

    `cd cider-ci/deploy`

3. We start the setup with the following command where we replace
    `192.168.0.31` with the IP address of our `demo-machine`:


    ```DEPLOY_ROOT_DIR=`pwd` ansible-playbook -i inventories/demo/easy/hosts play_site.yml -e 'ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.31 cider_ci_master_secret=secret admin_password=secret'```

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    You can leave the value of the `cider_ci_master_secret` and `admin_password`
    as is if your `demo-machine` cannot be accessed from "the outside". Otherwise
    you need to change them or virtually everbody has unrestricted access to
    your machine!
    </div>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="info">
Installing Cider-CI from scratch can take a while. 45 minutes are typical for
a virtual machine running on my laptop. The setup performs many downloads from
the internet which can be a reason for temporary failures. The playbook is
idempotent and thus can be rerun again at any time.
</div>


This is it. You can no visit your installation at
`http://IP-OF-YOUR-DEMO-MACHINE`. The setup will create an `admin` user with
the password `secret` (unless the parameters have been changed in step 3). The
setup also configured two projects. Run some of the jobs from the [Cider-CI
Bash Demo Project][] to learn about the capablities of Cider-CI.




## Next

Add your own project to your installation and configure it which is covered in
[Project Configuration](/project-configuration/). You will probably need a few
more traits on top of the default ones. Read about adding traits to your
executor in [Adding Traits](./adding-traits.html). If you want learn about how
to set up an production like Cider-CI environment read [Advanced
Installation]().
