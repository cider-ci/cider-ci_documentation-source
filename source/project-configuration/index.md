Project Configuration
=====================

This part of the documentation is about how to configure a project so Cider-CI
will run jobs on it. To that end two just two steps have to be performed:

1.  register repository with your instance of Cider-CI, and
2.  add a [Cider-CI Configuration File][] to the repository.

Registering a repository can be done via the administration section of the user
interface or by configuration of the deploy recipe.

The basic structure of the configuration file is described in the [Cider-CI
Configuration File][] page. The [Cider-CI Project Specification][] lists all
configuration options in a more formal manner.

Every configuration given here is demonstrated and brought in to context in the
[Cider-CI Bash Demo Project].
